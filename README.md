# crmtext-java
A Java library to support the CRMText API

To include, simply add this to your pom.xml file:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>cc.protea.crmtext</groupId>
  <artifactId>crmtext</artifactId>
  <version>0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

All methods are on the CRMText object which can be created with ```new CRMText(username, password, store)``` and in general their syntax matches the underlying CRMText operations.
